# PDF-Comparison-AI-Project

Introduction

Comparing specific values across multiple PDF documents manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to automate the comparison process using AI algorithms. By providing three PDF documents, you can easily identify and highlight the differences in the specified values. This can be particularly useful in scenarios like financial analysis, scientific research, and data validation.

Features

Automated Comparison: The AI system will automatically extract and compare the specified values from the provided PDF documents.
Value Highlighting: Differences in values will be clearly highlighted in the output, making it easy to identify variations.
Customizability: You can configure which values to compare and set the sensitivity threshold for value differences.
User-Friendly Interface: The tool provides a command-line interface (CLI) for easy interaction and quick results.
